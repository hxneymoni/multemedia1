                            Discord was started to solve a big problem: how to communicate with friends around the world while playing games online. Since childhood, founders Jason Citron and Stan Vishnevskiy both shared a love of video games, cherishing the friendships and connections that formed while playing them. At the time, all the tools built for this job were slow, unreliable, and complex. Jason and Stan knew they could make a better service that encouraged talking, helped form memories, and recreated the feeling of togetherness all found through gaming.

                        <p class="chapter-description">
                            So, in 2015, Stan and Jason started to bring Discord to life. People from all over the world loved it. Discord made it easy to genuinely communicate with friends, going beyond casual talking. Friends were staying in touch with their various communities. Discord was making it easy to participate in conversation, hopping around text, voice, and video to talk. The technology was complex but the goal was simple: make Discord an inviting and comfortable home to jump into with your communities and friends. Within a few years, Discord began to take off, and devoted people who loved our product sprung up around the world.
